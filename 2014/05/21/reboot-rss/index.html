<p>At <a href="https://www.superfeedr.com/">Superfeedr</a>, we’re convinced that one of the most important things to work on is to ease the subscription process. There are <a href="http://julien.svbtle.com/follow-buttons-everywhere">follow buttons everywhere</a> and more than ever <em>content discovery needs to happen outside of search engines</em>. Yet, feeds are left on the side of the road when it comes to that. <a href="https://www.subtome.com/">SubToMe</a> is an effort at fixing that in a <strong>decentralized, open and privacy-aware</strong> way!</p>

<p>In June, we will be at the “Reboot RSS” workshop and we’ll pitch that idea. We’ve heard from other people involved in the RSS world that they’re interested in seeing the <strong>formats</strong> evolve (maybe even JSON). Some other are interested in having <strong>better analytics</strong> mechanisms built in the feeds so that publishers have a better visibility on what happens to their content in the feeds they publish… Similarly, some asked for things like <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention">Webmentions</a> endpoints made available in feeds so people can remotely comment on the content they read… etc.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in coming, please, email julien@superfeedr.com</p>
