            <p><p><a href="http://flowreader.com">FlowReader</a> is a web-based personal news reader that offers a new way to browse online content, combining RSS feeds along with links and stories shared on Facebook and Twitter. </p>

<p>You can combine your Facebook, Twitter and Google account to extract content from all of them and then categorize, filter and read what you care about most. This is very handy!</p>

<p>From today, if you’re a FlowReader user, everytime you’ll see a SubToMe button, like on a <a href="/2014/04/13/subtome-in-feedburner/">Feedbuner feed</a>, for example, you’ll be redirected to FlowReader!</p>

            <p><p>If you’ve ever visited a Wordpress.com hosted blog, you’ve probably noticed that there are multiple buttons to follow that blog by email or using the <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a> reader. Now, if your blog is not hosted on Wordpress, you can easily <a href="http://docs.subtome.com/publishers/">add a SubToMe button</a> to your site so that more people follow it from their wordpress reader!</p>

<p>Similarly, if you use the Wordpress reader to follow your favorite sources of content online, you should add the <a href="https://www.subtome.com/#/settings">SubToMe bookmarklet</a> (or the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/subtome/cjkhnlmkkfheepafpgppmpdahbjgkjfc?hl=en">Chrome</a> or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/subtome-subscribe-button/">Firefox</a> addons) so that you can easily add our favorite sites to follow!</p>

<p>And for those who wonder, yes, this happened at the <a href="http://docs.subtome.com/2014/05/21/reboot-rss/">Reboot RSS workshop</a>! Our community can get so much done, much faster, when we know each other! </p>

<p>Happy following!</p>

            <p><p>The current <em>specifications for RSS and Atom are old</em> by the web standards and have not evolved in a long time. Yet, the way feeds are produced and consumed certainly has evolved. The <strong>reading experiences</strong> outside of RSS have evolved.  It’s time to reconcile things!</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.superfeedr.com/">Superfeedr</a>, we’re convinced that one of the most important things to work on is to ease the subscription process. There are <a href="http://julien.svbtle.com/follow-buttons-everywhere">follow buttons everywhere</a> and more than ever <em>content discovery needs to happen outside of search engines</em>. Yet, feeds are left on the side of the road when it comes to that. <a href="https://www.subtome.com/">SubToMe</a> is an effort at fixing that in a <strong>decentralized, open and privacy-aware</strong> way!</p>

<p>In June, we will be at the “Reboot RSS” workshop and we’ll pitch that idea. We’ve heard from other people involved in the RSS world that they’re interested in seeing the <strong>formats</strong> evolve (maybe even JSON). Some other are interested in having <strong>better analytics</strong> mechanisms built in the feeds so that publishers have a better visibility on what happens to their content in the feeds they publish… Similarly, some asked for things like <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention">Webmentions</a> endpoints made available in feeds so people can remotely comment on the content they read… etc.</p>

            <p><p>Earlier this week, SubToMe has been added to Feedburner! Feedburner is still an incredibly popular RSS feed platform which provides analytics and landing pages for RSS feed owners. It has not been getting a lot of attention form Google since they aquire it, but people still use it.</p>

<p>If you’re using Feedburner, make sure you allow SubToMe as one of the mechanisms to subscribe to the feed by going to <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/">Feedburner’s home page</a>. Then, in the <strong>Optimize Menu</strong>, pick <strong>BrowserFriendly</strong> and click on the <strong>Appearance</strong> option link. Make sure SubToMe is selected :)</p>

<p>Check the integration on these feeds for example: <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Indepthafrica">Indepthafrica</a>, <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/CanadianSecurity">CanadianSecurity</a> or <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Phase108">Phase108</a>.</p>

<p>This is an amazing piece of news, but don’t forget that if you integrate a SubToMe button directly into your site, you’ll get subscription stats, and you can style it in any way you like. Of course <em>SubToMe works really well with any feed</em>, including your Feedburner feed! This is all completely transparent to the user.</p>

<p>Happy subscribing!</p>

            <h2 class="title"><a href="/2014/03/17/subtome-openweb/" rel="prefetch">SubToMe and the Open Web</a></h2>
            <p><p>I am convinced that the web is currently <em>crippled</em> in many ways compared to the closed silos which are Android, iOS, but also the giant platforms like Google+, Facebook or Twitter. The web has an incredible set of advantages compared to this plaform: the distributed-ness, the ubiquity, the lack of gatekeeper… etc</p>

<p>Yet, in 2014, the open web is much harder to use on many many levels than these plaforms and that’s what we should address first. </p>

<h2 id="following">Following</h2>

<p>Following someone on a silo is often as easy as hitting a basic <strong>“Follow” button</strong>. Twitter does that extremely well, but Facebook, G+ and <a href="http://julien.svbtle.com/follow-buttons-everywhere">everybody else do it</a>. The problem is obvious: there is a <em>strong coupling</em> between the reading platform and the publishing platform: you need a Twitter account to follow me there. Yikes.</p>

<p>The web itself is an <strong>amazing publishing and reading platform</strong>, why then, couldn’t we have <em>web scale</em> buttons to follow sites we like using the tools we pick? This is what <a href="https://www.subtome.com/#/">SubToMe</a> does.</p>

<h2 id="open-ness">Open-ness</h2>

<p>I hope you’re questioning SubToMe’s openness. </p>

<p>The first, easy (yet skewed) answer would be to send you to the <a href="https://github.com/superfeedr/subtome/">source code</a>: it’s all in there, accessible to anyone for read and write: you can (and should) submit pull requests to make it better as some others have done in the past.</p>

<p>However, its openess is also guaranteed by the fact that it’s <strong>server-less</strong>. Most silos are probably built by good people. Yet, the economics of these silos are such that they need to lock your data in order to scale. Twitter needs to keep track of what you read if they want to show you relevant ads, Google needs to keep track of what you’re looking for to show you other ads… and paying services also have an incentive to lock you down if they want to guarantee their revenue stream (I’m looking at you, LinkedIn!).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.subtome.com/#/">SubToMe</a> is not like that: it does not run on a server, but in <strong>your</strong> browser, fully. The consequence is that it’s completey free to run (except for the domain name hosting), and scales extremely well. Even when hundreds of milions of people use the button, the cost of making it available is the cost of bandwidth spent to download its <em>couple  KiloBytes once</em>. This means, that there will <em>never</em> be a need for SubToMe to charge or put ads in front of its users.</p>

<p>So, not only not being open would be <strong>technically challenging</strong>, but it would also be <strong>economically difficult to sustain</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="then-why-do-you-care">Then why do you care?</h2>

<p>When somebody claims they’re doing <strong>the right thing</strong>, it’s mandatory to ask them what it their motive. After all, these silos are profitable businesses and they pay their employees significantly as well. Why not do the same?</p>

<p>Because I’m <strong>not into growing a slice, but into growing a pie</strong>. I am convinced that these silos are growing at the expense of the rest of the web. As time passes, we visit less and less different websites. And these few websites are probably receiving an increasing share of the total web’s revenues. My bet is that the web, like nature is stronger when there is more diversity, and I’d argue that the <strong>webdiversity</strong> is currently going down, exactly like its natural counterpart.</p>

<p><a href="https://superfeedr.com/">My business</a> is also based on the amount of webdiversity. In a <em>distributed world, it’s hard to collect data from thousands or milions of different sites</em> and the need for services like <a href="https://superfeedr.com/">Superfeedr</a> exists. I believe our insterests in terms of open-ness is perfectly aligned with our business interest, which is why we picked open protocols for our API, and why we’re doing <a href="https://www.subtome.com/#/">SubToMe</a>.</p>
